module Graphics.QML (
-- * Overview
{-|
HsQML layers a low to medium level Haskell API on top of the C++ Qt Quick
framework. It allows you to write graphical applications where the front-end is 
written in Qt Quick's QML language (incorporating JavaScript) and the back-end
is written in Haskell. To this end, this library provides two pieces of
functionality:-

The 'Graphics.QML.Engine' module allows you to create windows which host QML
content. You can specify a custom global object to be made available to the
JavaScript running inside the content. In this way, the content can interface
with the Haskell program.

The 'Graphics.QML.Objects' module allows you to define your own custom object
types which can be marshalled between Haskell and JavaScript.
 -}
-- * Script-side APIs
{-|
The @window@ object provides the following methods and properties to QML
scripts.

/Properties/

[@source : url@] URL for the Window's QML document.

[@title : string@] Window title.

[@visible : bool@] Window visibility.

/Methods/

[@close()@] Closes the window.
